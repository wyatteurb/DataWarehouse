This project is about data warehouse to load data from source to destination source. In order to completed this project, we have to design and create table such as dimension table and fact table also staging table. Because we use aws redshift then we need to setup all the configuration for creating output properly.
In order to run this project we can write code in python by jupyter notebook which I used to run all these files. If we use IaC then we need to import all libraries which required for this project. We have to setup aws redshift to create cluster for etl. In the project you will see the files that for etl I will explain about it in this project. create_tables.py is used for dropping and creating table. etl.py used for loading and inserting data from staging to dimension and fact table. sql_queries.py is the sql query that used for create_tables.py and etl.py. dwh.cfg is the configuration file which is used for aws redshift to create cluster and other files.
To run these files you can use outputtest.ipynb.
